  I have been working as a Technical Recruiter for almost 2 years. All these
  days where we can just code and be happy are gone. Soft-skills are sharpening
  as a crucial ability in the IT world, especially Frontend. Co-op with
  Designers, Product Owners, clients, brainstorming with the team are just a few
  terms which require excellent communication skills. Don't get me wrong,
  problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, logic mind and desire to learn
  are still up to date, but to be the best, it's time to combine these two
  different worlds. Let's jump into the topic and learn how can you improve your
  next interview.
