desc: Learning is a process of every human being. Starting from learning how to walk, ride a bike, how to study, pass exams, and prepare for the work. It‚Äôs an exercise we do everyday almost like a workout. However, it‚Äôs no longer enough to just learn, the modern world is all about optimizing time and being as productive as possible.

  <Title level={3}>Introduction</Title>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    I love to learn new things and it became my hobby to find new ways for
    boosting the effectiveness and capabilities of the mind. It has helped me
    during all these years of being a League of Legends Player, Coach, Java
    Tester, Frontend Developer, Recruiter, and now, a Mentor.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>5 ways</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    I prepared 5 ways to learn more effectively, there is a chance you are using
    some of them already,{' '}
    <Text strong>
      but understanding why can always help you learn even faster than now
    </Text>
    .
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>Let's dive in.</Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>1. Music for your brain</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Neurons in our brains use electricity to communicate with each other. This
    in turn generates electrical activity and brain waves are created.{' '}
    <Text strong>Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta waves</Text>. Music on the
    right frequency also creates these waves. We don‚Äôt even realize how music
    can manipulate us, affect our focus, relaxing, creativity, and many other
    traits. It all comes down to stimulating the brain.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Before we start listening to new songs, it's worth getting quality
    headphones. I‚Äôm using{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</Link>. They
    have great quality, are soundproof, and even waterproof (I checked it once,
    can confirm üòÖ).
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Getting back to the waves,{' '}
    <Text strong>
      I mostly listen to songs with alpha waves, if I need an influx of
      creativity and a feeling of relaxation. Beta waves, in turn, help me when
      I spend time on concentrating, acquiring new knowledge, and also when I
      need to think logically or solve some algorithms
    </Text>
    .
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    I haven't tried songs with other waves yet, but gamma waves could be useful
    for multitasking and remembering associations. Delta waves are best suited
    for meditation and deep focus. Also, helpful if someone has trouble falling
    asleep. Theta waves strengthen memory.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Below is a list of songs I recommend when starting with this learning
    approach:
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={songs} />
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Classical music is probably one of the best if it comes to deep focus while
    learning. You can find some classical music songs on e.g.{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</Link>, searching by keywords
    such as <Text strong>study music</Text>,{' '}
    <Text strong>concentration music</Text>, <Text strong>alpha waves</Text>,{' '}
    <Text strong>beta waves</Text>, etc.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>2. Mind mapping - use both hemispheres</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    While studying for the exam, I bet that many of you've used cheat sheets. It
    takes time, accuracy, and a lot of consideration to make a good cheat sheet.
    It's usually a summary of the most important information from the entire
    semester, book, or presentation. Unfortunately, after passing the exam, it
    is lost forever, and the knowledge most often evaporates with it.
    <Text strong>
      {' '}
      During the whole process, we only use the left hemisphere of the brain,
      responsible for numbers, words, and logical thinking
    </Text>.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    When making notes, not necessarily cheat sheets, we can add symbols, colors,
    minimalistic drawings, connect everything with arrows, and in the center,
    e.g. on the card of paper, place the keywords, sentences, statements, or
    dates. And that's how we create a mind map which activates the right
    hemisphere.
    <Text strong>
      {' '}
      Then, both hemispheres work synergistically with each other, increasing
      our efficiency while learning
    </Text>.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Before I got to know this method, I kept writing the most important
    information in the form of traditional notes, often they were several pages
    long and it was difficult to get a hang of it. This way of learning quickly
    becomes boring and imitative. Using a mind map, we can stimulate our mind to
    <Text fontStyle="italic">"play"</Text>, making it, but also us, enjoying the
    learning. A very crucial element of correct mind mapping is legibility, try to
    write neatly. Additionally, you will get a practice of handwriting.

  <PostList data={mindmapSteps} />
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Mind mapping is especially useful when I'm trying to explore a new topic and
    don't know where to start. A mind map allows me to get a clear structure and
    makes a plan of what I really need to learn. It‚Äôs also super helpful for
    creating and solving algorithms with concrete business logic to represent
    all steps, edge cases. In general, it feels good to brainstorm and draw
    something, just in a geek, IT style, on an old-school board. (When you
    become a master of mind mapping, it‚Äôs time to stop wasting paper and
    visualize everything in the mind, just like a{' '}

  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>3. Stay hydrated and eat something</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>The human brain consists of 83% water</Text>. Poor hydration
    leads to attention disorders and concentration. Water cleanses the body and
    oxygenates the brain. I‚Äôve heard different opinions on how much water we
    should drink during the day. There're opinions of 7-8 glasses, and sometimes
    it is mentioned to drink from 1.5 liters to 3 liters of liquids (including
    those from food). I believe that this is an individual matter and it‚Äôs best
    to consult it with a dietitian.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    I personally drink about 2 liters of water a day, in small sips, quite
    often. I always have a bottle of water next to my desk, even now. I buy
    sparkling water for one week and still water for the second.{' '}
    <Text strong>
      Excess water can poison the body, and sparkling water flushes vitamins - I
      have heard such opinions, but since I started drinking sparkling and still
      water alternating weekly periods, I have the impression that my comfort
      has improved
    </Text>
    . I rarely drink other beverages, but I would try to avoid energy drinks. It‚Äôs
    definitely worth recharging yourself with vitamins from freshly squeezed fruit
    or vegetables. Drink a cup of tea, coffee, or your favorite herbs. Just don't
    overdo it.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    <Text fontStyle="italic">‚ÄûYou are what you eat‚Äù</Text> ‚Äì healthy eating is
    certainly an efficient method of effective learning.{' '}
    <Text strong>
      Foods rich in iron (memory improvement), lecithin (also better
      remembering), vitamin B12, C, A, and E (concentration), vitamin D (memory
      again) are almost essential while learning
    </Text>
    . First of all, when we are hungry, we cannot focus and we get nervous quickly.
    Snacks can help with that - let's keep them healthy. They will support the work
    of our brain, and not everything will go to the sides! I usually prepare a few
    pieces of dark chocolate, almonds, and e.g. peanuts in a small bowl. Usually
    this is enough for a few hours of study and fills the gap between main meals.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>4. Take a break</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    We all work in front of the computer. The Polish health and safety at work
    state that I am entitled to a 5-minute break after each hour worked in front
    of the screen monitor. Sometimes it is difficult to break away from a task,
    chapter in a book, or from writing, for example, a guide you are reading
    now. I have a problem with it (I'm working on it üòÄ), usually, I try to
    finish something at all costs, skipping the hellishly important breaks in
    between.{' '}
    <Text strong>
      For some time now, I started using the 5-minute break rule and noticed a
      significant increase in productivity
    </Text>
    .
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    We remember best what we learn at the beginning and end of a given time
    period, in this case - an hour. Use these 5 minutes to stretch your bones,
    get out in the fresh air, or even exercise for a while, and oxygenate your
    brain. Sometimes I was lingering far too long in front of the computer, 3 or
    more hours without contact with reality, trying to solve a problem.{' '}
    <Text strong>
      Most often, when I was forced to take a break due to fatigue, I came up
      with a solution
    </Text>
    . Then, I realized 5 minutes could be more valuable than a few hours, and time
    is indeed relative.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>5. Imagine you already know it</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    While browsing the internet to explore various methods of effective
    learning, I came across something which intrigued me. There is such a
    concept as{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/self-motivation.html">
      Self-Motivation
    </Link>
    , and each of you will probably agree that feeling better helps us in everything.
    Nothing in life is more enjoyable than being appreciated and rewarded. <Text fontStyle="italic">
      "Well done"
    </Text>, <Text fontStyle="italic">"You've done well"</Text> - such sentences,
    especially when spoken by loved ones, make us more valuable and motivate us to
    continue our actions.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph strong>
    There is also the possibility of cheating our brain.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    We can imagine ourselves, e.g. standing somewhere in the room, and
    convincing our mind what we have to learn - we already learned. Let's agree
    that is the{' '}
    <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo">Placebo</Link> effect
    supposed to affect our psyche. Whenever I sit down at my desk to learn
    something new, my thoughts drift away to the world of dreams for a while and
    I tell myself,{' '}
    <Text fontStyle="italic">
      "What would it be like if I were already an expert in this field"
    </Text>
    . After a while, I come back to reality and my confidence is on a completely
    different level. With a light spirit, I start learning in an ideal state of mind.
