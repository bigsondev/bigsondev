  <Title level={3}>Introduction</Title>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    We all want to learn coding fast, get our dream jobs and earn money quickly
    ü§ë. Firstly, we have to be systematic. Secondly, our brain can't receive the
    same learning method over and over again. Let's find out what different
    approaches we can take to improve as developers.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Practice Coding Challenges</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    It‚Äôs good to practice algorithms, solve problems as a Developer. Logical
    thinking is a crucial ability to succeed and grow in the IT field. Focusing
    on only one project can lead to quicker burnout, hence switching context can
    help to keep the right balance.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph strong>
    Don‚Äôt overload yourself with coding challenges, try to do at least one per
    day.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Please, find the recommended websites to practice coding below.
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={codingChallengesWebsites} />
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    <Text strong>Note:</Text> I would totally aim for Codewars first as it‚Äôs
    free and you start from fairly basic coding challenges. Don‚Äôt spend more
    than 1 hour per day on this, otherwise, your brain might ü§Ø.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Stay up-to-date by reading</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Frontend evolves at a lightning-fast pace. You have to keep that tempo. One
    article per day, per week, just make sure to be systematic.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    There is this amazing browser extension to help you read only what‚Äôs loved
    by other developers.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    <Link href="https://daily.dev/">daily.dev</Link> - It will fulfill your
    browser landing page with articles.{' '}
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    If you still have time to read a bit more, I recommend the following
    websites.
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={codingReadingWebsites} />
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    <Text strong>Note:</Text> I highly recommend implementing what you‚Äôve
    learned, as just reading won‚Äôt keep the knowledge with you. Decrease the
    number of articles you read, don‚Äôt aim for super complex things such as
    Machine Learning, AI for starting. Read about React, Flexbox, Grid System,
    topics you are already working on, and want to expand your skills even
    further there.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Projects to build</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>Note:</Text> It‚Äôs best to build what drives you the most, or
    even better if you can build for a friend, family. That will boost your
    motivation even further üöÄ. Try to think about something you really want to
    have, a portfolio, website related to your hobbies, application you always
    thought of. If it‚Äôs a complex idea, try to simplify, make sure there is at
    least a piece of it you will be capable of building and seeing your dream
    project live running on a deployed website.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    If there is nothing from the above you can think of, that's ok. I‚Äôll share
    some links for references below.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph strong>
    Just remember to focus on one project at a time. If it grows and you feel
    that you won‚Äôt make it - decrease the scope, break on smaller pieces, don't
    be too ambitious, don't overdo.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Below you can find the list of websites with project ideas.
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={codingProjectsWebsites} />
  <Paragraph lastParagraph />
  <Title level={3}>Courses, Videos, Books</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Previously described approaches for improving as a Frontend Developer cover
    a lot already. If you don‚Äôt have too much time to learn, adding courses,
    videos or books might overwhelm you.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    I‚Äôm a fan of practicing by building, courses, videos, books approach only
    makes sense if you are completely stuck. Take a break from the project you
    are working on and watch a related course, video, or read a book. It might
    be a waste of time to go through all parts, try to look for the ones that
    cover your exact problem.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Don‚Äôt watch or read too much at once as you will quickly forget it, go step
    by step and try to implement what you‚Äôve learned along the way, maybe it
    will even unblock you with the project.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The below list includes some of the platforms I‚Äôve been learning on.
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={codingCoursesBooksWebistes} />
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    <Text strong>Note:</Text> Another downside is that you have to pay for the
    above, I highly recommend sticking to the first three approaches first as it
    will save some of your budget. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve learned a lot from books
    or courses. The most progress I noticed was with a dedicated Mentor and by
    building things from the scratch.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Sum Up</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    1 hour of coding challenge per day, if it's too hard, just try a simpler
    one, or move it to the next day. Read, but not all the time, try to stick to
    the topics you are learning and implement freshly absorbed knowledge. It
    will click faster. Practice by building projects and spend most of the time
    on it. Read, watch only if you are completely stuck. Mix often, your brain
    won't be bored.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    Try different approaches, connect them together and shape up your unique
    learning process to skyrocket in Frontend üöÄ.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Closing Notes</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    I have faith in you, shall you not give up and continue this tough, Frontend
    journey to improve coding skills. üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
