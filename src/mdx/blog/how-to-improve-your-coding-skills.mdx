  <Title level={3}>Introduction</Title>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    We all want to learn coding fast, get our dream jobs and earn money quickly
    ðŸ¤‘. Firstly, we have to be systematic. Secondly, our brain can't receive the
    same learning method over and over again. Let's find out what different
    approaches we can take to improve as developers.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Practice Coding Challenges</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Itâ€™s good to practice algorithms, solve problems as a Developer. Logical
    thinking is a crucial ability to succeed and grow in the IT field. Focusing
    on only one project can lead to quicker burnout, hence switching context can
    help to keep the right balance.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph strong>
    Donâ€™t overload yourself with coding challenges, try to do at least one per
    day.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Please, find the recommended websites to practice coding below.
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={codingChallengesWebsites} />
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    <Text strong>Note:</Text> I would totally aim for Codewars first as itâ€™s
    free and you start from fairly basic coding challenges. Donâ€™t spend more
    than 1 hour per day on this, otherwise, your brain might ðŸ¤¯.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Stay up-to-date by reading</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Frontend evolves at a lightning-fast pace. You have to keep that tempo. One
    article per day, per week, just make sure to be systematic.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    There is this amazing browser extension to help you read only whatâ€™s loved
    by other developers.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    <Link href="https://daily.dev/">daily.dev</Link> - It will fulfill your
    browser landing page with articles.{' '}
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    If you still have time to read a bit more, I recommend the following
    websites.
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={codingReadingWebsites} />
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    <Text strong>Note:</Text> I highly recommend implementing what youâ€™ve
    learned, as just reading wonâ€™t keep the knowledge with you. Decrease the
    number of articles you read, donâ€™t aim for super complex things such as
    Machine Learning, AI for starting. Read about React, Flexbox, Grid System,
    topics you're already working on, and want to expand your skills even
    further there.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Projects to build</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Itâ€™s best to build what drives you the most, or even better if you can build
    for a friend, family. That will boost your motivation even further ðŸš€. Try
    to think about something you really want to have, a portfolio, website
    related to your hobbies, application you always thought of. If itâ€™s a
    complex idea, try to simplify, make sure there is at least a piece of it you
    will be capable of building and seeing your dream project live running on a
    deployed website.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    If there is nothing from the above you can think of, that's ok. Iâ€™ll share
    some links for references below.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Below you can find the list of websites with project ideas.
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={codingProjectsWebsites} />
  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>Note:</Text> Just remember to focus on one project at a time.
    If it grows and you feel that you wonâ€™t make it - decrease the scope, break
    on smaller pieces, don't be too ambitious, don't overdo.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph />
  <Title level={3}>Courses, Videos, Books</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Iâ€™m a fan of practicing by building but courses, videos, books are a nice
    addition to your knowledge pack. Take a break from the project you're
    working on and watch a related course, video, or read a book.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Having a collection of courses, videos, books related to Frontend
    Development is great just avoid "from cover to cover" and have it as a
    reference. Search for the problem you're trying to solve, and follow the
    instructions, move one step closer, rinse and repeat.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The below list includes some of the platforms Iâ€™ve been learning on.
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={codingCoursesBooksWebistes} />
  <Paragraph>
    Additionally, these free books are great to improve JavaScript and to have a
    good grasp of Frontend Development:

  <Paragraph lastParagraph />
  <Title level={3}>Sum Up</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    1 hour of Frontend challenge per day, if it's too hard, just try a simpler
    one, or move it to the next day. Read, but not all the time, try to stick to
    the topics you're learning and implement freshly absorbed knowledge. It will
    click faster. Practice by building projects.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Read, watch, search for a particular problem you're trying to solve.{' '}
    <Text strong>Hands-on the code as fast as you can</Text>. Mix often, your
    brain won't be bored.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    Try different approaches, connect them together, and shape up your unique
    learning process to skyrocket in Frontend Development. ðŸš€
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Closing Notes</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    I have faith in you, shall you not give up and continue this tough, Frontend
    journey to improve your skills.
