  <Title level={3}>Introduction</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    I have been working as a <Text>Technical Recruiter for almost 2 years</Text>
    . All these days where we can just code and be happy are gone. Soft-skills
    are sharpening as a crucial ability in the IT world, especially Frontend.
    Co-op with Designers, Product Owners, Clients, brainstorming with the Team
    is just a few terms that require excellent communication skills.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    Don't get me wrong, problem-solving skills, great mind, and desire to learn
    are still up to date but to be the best, it's time to combine these two
    different worlds.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>The Actual Tips</Title>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Let's jump into the topic and learn how you can improve your next interview.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>1. Research the company</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    What are the main projects? For which clients do they make these projects?
    What is the company size? What are the recent activities/events the company
    organized?
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The above questions are the bare minimum you should research. If it's
    possible, attend meetups (more likely Webinars due to COVID situation in the
    world). It's important to show your interests by knowing about the company
    activities, history, technologies they use, and so on.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    A very common question during the interview is -{' '}
    <Text strong>What do you know about us?</Text>
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Don't lose the chance. <Text strong>Research</Text>.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>2. Study your CV one more time</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Look for typos, check contact details, and links to projects on{' '}
    <Link href="https://github.com/">GitHub</Link> or other platforms. Be honest
    with the knowledge, when you don't have too much experience, there can be
    that irresistible feeling to pack CV with technologies you might not use at
    all.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Instead, do some side projects, learn technologies that are most used, and
    enhance your CV with them. You will have strong arguments with the side
    projects and feel more confident. Don't forget about mentioning soft skills
    which could consist of <Text strong>being a team player</Text>,{' '}
    <Text strong>open-minded</Text>, <Text strong>like brainstorming</Text>,
    etc.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>3. Practice communication skills and language</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Chances are that English is not your native language, and neither it's mine.
    The practice is a different thing. Watch courses in English, e.g. on{' '}
    <Link href="https://egghead.io/">Egghead</Link>,{' '}
    <Link href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</Link>,{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</Link>, or{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</Link>.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    You can kill two birds with one stone, become fluent with additional
    language, and get some extra knowledge Frontend related.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Remember about looking at the recruiter, don't get frustrated, don't speak
    too fast, control your speech. If you're confident enough,{' '}
    <Text strong>lead the conversation towards your strengths</Text>, make a
    situational joke.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>Believe in yourself.</Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>4. Say hi and be nice</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    It's connected with the previous tip, but just a simple{' '}
    <Text strong>Hi</Text> at the start can change the first impression
    diametrically.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    There is a{' '}
    <Link href="https://cxl.com/blog/cialdinis-principles-persuasion/">
      Rule of Sympathy
    </Link>{' '}
    which can help a lot during the interview. Recruiters love enthusiastic
    candidates, believe or not, but you can make friends within the conversation
    for a new job.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>5. Do some katas</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Algorithms, a little bit of JS practice will train your brain, after all,
    it's a muscle that needs some help from you to grow. Try out katas on{' '}
    <Link href="codewars.com">Codewars</Link>. If you like games,{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.codingame.com/">CodinGame</Link> is great. For
    analytical minds,{' '}
    <Link href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</Link> will be perfect.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Practicing before the interview will make you more confident and prepared
    for potential code challenges.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    If the interview is fully online, prepare a microphone, camera, internet
    connection, and all the tools you need. Usually, it's on{' '}
    <Link href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</Link>,{' '}
    <Link href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</Link>, or similar code editors
    with live sharing enabled. Otherwise, ask an HR person who contacted you if
    you need to bring a Laptop.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>6. Prepare questions and answers before</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Ask about benefits, work culture, project you will work on if you pass the
    interview. Ask about activities, events, the team.{' '}
    <Text strong>Write questions down one day before the interview</Text>, it
    will help you to remember. It's quite common to forget important things when
    you're under the pressure or stressed. Overcome it.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    It's also worth preparing for questions. What was the biggest challenge in
    your previous work? Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Describe your
    previous projects and work.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    The above are just the examples, you can research for more, but take{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/common-technical-interview-questions-and-answers">
      this list
    </Link>{' '}
    as an example of questions you will need to answer.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>7. Do Mock Interview</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Call it a warm-up or pre-interview.{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.pramp.com/#/">Services</Link> like this exist, there
    are plenty of them on the Web, but they're usually very general and have a
    hardcoded plan which won't prepare you well enough.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    It appears I offer such services.{' '}
    <Text strong>
      I'll first treat you individually and get to know what is your skill level
      and experience
    </Text>
    . Then we'll have <GatsbyLink
      to="/mentorship"
      style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}
    >
      Mock Interview
    </GatsbyLink> targeted at a concrete position such as <Text strong>
      Junior
    </Text>, <Text strong>Regular</Text> or <Text strong>Senior</Text>. When I was
    being interviewed, I received feedback rarely and it didn't motivate me.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    After Mock Interview with me, I'll send you{' '}
    <Text strong>robust feedback</Text> which will help with the future learning
    and simplify understanding where you're in your Frontend career. Sometimes
    we delay the raise, because of being unsure about our skills.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>Let's change that.</Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>8. Relieve Stress</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Maybe you already know how to deal with the stress, but often we get angry,
    scream, or hide in a cozy corner to avoid everyone.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>Meditation</Text> or I would rather say exercises to control
    your breath can help you relax. I recommend{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</Link> as it's very well suited for
    beginners. Try it out, maybe it's the way for you to relieve stress.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    If that doesn't help, you can{' '}
    <Text strong>try to understand your feelings</Text> by learning what makes
    you angry or being shy. This exercise will help you to work out better
    control over yourself.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Stress during the interview can mess up with your memory, block from
    answering the questions. It's good to overcome it.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>9. Sleep, Eat and Drink well</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>Our brains are mostly made out of the water</Text>, drink
    often, not all at once, but around 8 glasses per day. Use{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.lifehack.org/668261/best-habit-tracking-apps">
      Habit tracking apps
    </Link>{' '}
    to help you remember.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    After executing the previous step, you should already know how to deal with
    the stress, <Text strong>get some good sleep</Text>, and wake up refreshed
    and full of energy for the interview.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>10. Surprise Everyone</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    In the past, I was mentoring my friend and helping him with writing the CV.
    He added a note about understanding{' '}
    <Text strong>Graceful Degradation and Progressive Enhancement</Text> in it.
    Thanks to that, he was invited to the interview and succeded at it.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    Knowing weird or geek things as a Developer is a great way to shine during
    the recruitment process. Mention some hobby, technology, or anything that
    makes you special. It will earn you bonus points and maybe even{' '}
    <Text>prevail about the result</Text>.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Closing Notes</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    I hope the above list was something new and you could learn a thing or two
    from it. Sharing is caring and that's why I prepared homework to let you
    practice before the next interview. <Text strong>Thank you</Text> for
    reading and good luck. ❤️
