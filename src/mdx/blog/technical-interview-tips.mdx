<Title level={3}>Introduction</Title>
<Paragraph>
  I have been working as a{' '}
  <Text strong>Technical Recruiter for almost 2 years</Text>. All these days
  where we can just code and be happy are gone. Soft-skills are sharpening as a
  crucial ability in the IT world, especially Frontend. Co-op with Designers,
  Product Owners, clients, brainstorming with the team are just a few terms
  which require excellent communication skills.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  Don't get me wrong, problem-solving skills, great mind and desire to learn are
  still up to date, but to be the best, it's time to combine these two different
  worlds.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  Let's jump into the topic and learn how you can improve your next interview.
</Paragraph>
<Title level={3}>The Actual Tips</Title>
<Paragraph>
  Soft skills, logical thinking, coding kata practice, being honest, being
  enthusiastic, stress relief, meditation, sleep and more are crucial keywords
  for <Text strong>succeeding at the interview</Text>.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  I hope the following list will be something new and you can learn from it.
  Sharing is caring, goodluck with your next interview!
</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>1. Research the company</Title>
<Paragraph>
  What are the main projects? For which clients do they make these projects?
  What is the company size? What are the recent activities/events the company
  organized?
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The above questions are a bare minimum you should research. If it's possible,
  attend meetups (more likely Webinars due to COVID situation in the world).
  It's important to show your interests by knowing about the company activities,
  history, technologies they use and so on.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  A very common question during the interview is -{' '}
  <Text strong>What do you know about us?</Text>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  Don't lose the chance. <Text strong>Research</Text>.
</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>2. Study your CV one more time</Title>
<Paragraph>
  Look for typos, check contact details, links to your projects on{' '}
  <Link href="https://github.com/">GitHub</Link> or other platforms. Be honest
  with your knowledge, when you don't have too much experience, you can have
  that irresistible feeling to pack your CV with technologies which you might
  not use at all.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  Instead, do some side projects, learn which technologies are most used and
  enhance your CV with these. You will have strong arguments with the side
  projects and feel more confident. Don't forget about mentioning soft skills
  which could consist of <Text strong>being a team player</Text>,{' '}
  <Text strong>open minded</Text>, <Text strong>likes brainstorming</Text> etc.
</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>3. Practice communication skills and language</Title>
<Paragraph>
  Chances are that English is not your native language, and neither is it for
  me. Practice is a different thing. Watch courses in English, e.g. on{' '}
  <Link href="https://egghead.io/">Egghead</Link>,{' '}
  <Link href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</Link>,{' '}
  <Link href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</Link> or{' '}
  <Link href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</Link>.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  You can kill two birds with one stone, become fluent with additional language
  and get some extra knowledge Frontend related.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  Remember about looking at the recruiter, don't get frustrated, don't speak too
  fast, control your speech. If you are confident enough,{' '}
  <Text strong>lead the conversation towards your strengths</Text>, make a
  situational joke.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>Believe in yourself.</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>4. Say hi and be nice</Title>
<Paragraph>
  It's connected with the previous tip, but just a simple <Text strong>Hi</Text>{' '}
  at the start can change first impression diametrically.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  There is a{' '}
  <Link href="https://cxl.com/blog/cialdinis-principles-persuasion/">
    Rule of Sympathy
  </Link>{' '}
  which can help a lot during the interview. Recruiters love enthusiastic
  candidates, believe or not, but you can make friends within the conversation
  for a new job.
</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>5. Do some katas</Title>
<Paragraph>
  Algorithms, a little bit of JS practice, will train your brain, after all it's
  a muscle which needs some help from you to grow. Try out katas on{' '}
  <Link href="codewars.com">Codewars</Link>. If you like games,{' '}
  <Link href="https://www.codingame.com/">CodinGame</Link> is great. For
  analytical minds, <Link href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</Link>{' '}
  will be perfect.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>
    Practicing before the interview will make you more confident and prepared
    for potential code challenges.
  </Text>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  If interview is fully online, prepare microphone, camera, internet connection
  and all the tools you need. Usually it's on{' '}
  <Link href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</Link>,{' '}
  <Link href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</Link> or similar code editors
  with live sharing enabled. Otherwise ask a HR person who contacted you if you
  need to bring a Laptop.
</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>6. Prepare questions and answers before</Title>
<Paragraph>
  Ask about benefits, work culture, project you will work on if you pass the
  interview. Ask about activities, events, the team.{' '}
  <Text strong>Write questions down one day before the interview</Text>, it will
  help you to remember. It's quite common to forget an important things when you
  are under the pressure or stressed. Overcome it.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  It's also worth preparing for questions. What was the biggest challenge in
  your previous work? Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Describe your
  previous projects and work.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  The above are just the examples, you can research for more, but take{' '}
  <Link href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/common-technical-interview-questions-and-answers">
    this list
  </Link>{' '}
  as an example of questions you will need to answer.
</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>7. Do Mock Interview</Title>
<Paragraph>
  Call it a warmup or pre-interview.{' '}
  <Link href="https://www.pramp.com/#/">Services</Link> like this exists, there
  are plenty of them on the Web, but they are usually very general and have
  hardcoded plan which won't prepare you well enough.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  It appears I offer such services.{' '}
  <Text strong>
    I will first treat you individually and get to know what is your skill level
    and experience
  </Text>
  . After that we will have a <Link href="#">Mock Interview</Link> targeted at concrete
  position such as <Text strong>Junior</Text>, <Text strong>Regular</Text> or <Text
    strong
  >
    Senior
  </Text>. When I was being interviewed, I received feedback rarely and it didn't
  motivate me.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  After the Mock Interview with me, I will send you a{' '}
  <Text strong>robust feedback</Text> which will help with the future learning
  and simplify understanding where you are in your IT career. Sometimes we delay
  the raise, because of being unsure about our skills.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>Let's change that.</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>8. Relieve Stress</Title>
<Paragraph>
  Maybe you already know how to deal with the stress, but often we get angry,
  scream or hide in a cozy corner to avoid everyone.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Meditation</Text>, or I would rather say exercises to control
  your breath can help you relax. I recommend{' '}
  <Link href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</Link> as it's very well suited for
  beginners. Try it out, maybe it's the way for you to relieve stress.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  If that doesn't help, you can{' '}
  <Text strong>try to understand your feelings</Text> by learning what makes you
  angry or being shy. This exercise will help you to work out better control
  over yourself.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  Stress during the interview can mess up with your memory, block from answering
  the questions. It's good to overcome it.
</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>9. Sleep, Eat and Drink well</Title>
<Paragraph>
  <Text strong>Our brains are mostly made out of water</Text>, drink often, not
  all at once, but around 8 glasses per day. Use{' '}
  <Link href="https://www.lifehack.org/668261/best-habit-tracking-apps">
    Habit tracking apps
  </Link>{' '}
  to help you remember.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  After executing the previous step, you should already know how to deal with
  the stress, <Text strong>get some good sleep</Text> and wake up refreshed and
  full of energy for the interview.
</Paragraph>
<Title level={4}>10. Surprise Everyone</Title>
<Paragraph>
  In the past I was mentoring my friend and helping him with writing the CV. He
  added a note about understanding{' '}
  <Text strong>Graceful Degradation and Progressive Enhancment</Text> in it.
  Thanks to that, he was invited to the interview and succeded at it.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph lastParagraph>
  Knowing weird or geek things as a Developer is a great way to shine during the
  recruitment process. Mention some hobby, technology or anything what makes you
  special. It will earn you bonus points and maybe even{' '}
  <Text strong>prevail about the result</Text>.
</Paragraph>
