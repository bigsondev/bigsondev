    In this article, we'll build a Pokemon application using{' '}

  <Paragraph>
    Function components in <Link href="https://reactjs.org/">React</Link> are
    great but data fetching with them can be cumbersome at first. When I moved
    into using hooks it took me some time to grasp what's going on. If you're
    starting out, check out{' '}
    <Link href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">

    from the official documentation. Additionally, read about{' '}
    <Link href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html">useState</Link> and{' '}
    <Link href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html">useEffect</Link>{' '}
    hooks as we'll need them.

  <Paragraph>
    I'll start from using{' '}
    <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">
      fetch
    </Link>{' '}
    to get the data from PokeAPI, then refactor the code for using a custom{' '}
    <Text code>useApi</Text> hook with{' '}
    <Link href="https://github.com/axios/axios">axios</Link>, and end up with{' '}
    <Link href="">react-query</Link> as it's an amazing library.

    In the end, you should have a fair understanding of hooks, data fetching in
    React and build the below cool application about Pokemons. ðŸ˜Ž
