title: Collaboration Between Developers And Designers - Part 1
desc: Finding a common language is not a simple task. Developers think in a more abstract way, focusing on functionalities, trying to reuse components, avoid duplications in the first place. On the other side, designers treat things more visually, need to present them to clients, and argument value behind their designs. But, designers also have common properties, components, and sometimes, even patterns to avoid duplication and repeating themselves. Developers and designers have more similarities than they think. They just don‚Äôt speak the same language, hence the confusion and miscommunication happen from time to time.

    I worked in an{' '}

    . Iterations, sprints, demos are all part of that. There is a lot of communication
    and collaboration needed to succeed.

  <Paragraph>
    In this series I‚Äôll try to share my experiences working as a Frontend
    Developer and Tech Leader, describing collaboration with designers on
    different aspects of the project, from product development, features
    creation to building a design system.

  <Title level={3}>Problem - Lack Of Understanding</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Not all designers are developers and not all developers are designers. It‚Äôs
    great if developers can understand{' '}
    <Link href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">
      Atomic Design
    </Link>
    , usability, accessibility, the importance of spacing between elements, typography,
    color rules, but usually, the main focus is to implement functionality without
    considering all of it, just following a design.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    It can lead to more code duplication, lack of UI, UX patterns consistency,
    as it all won‚Äôt be caught during the design review or implementation.{' '}
    <Text strong>And the end result will be confusion for users</Text>.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    On the other side, It‚Äôs fantastic if the designer understands the concepts
    of{' '}

    , had some hands-on HTML, CSS, maybe even basics of JS, and is familiar with
    browser limitations. Additionally, understands what are props in <Link href="https://en.reactjs.org/">
      React
    </Link> or other popular frameworks, knows a bit about components composition,
    etc. Unfortunately, sometimes this knowledge is ignored and the final design
    increases implementation time due to skipping some of the mentioned concepts.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph strong lastParagraph>
    We tend to focus on delivering tasks in a manner that is convenient for us
    under the time pressure and without realizing, making the work more complex
    for others. The reason for this is usually a lack of knowledge or not
    understanding each other workflows.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Solutions</Title>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Happily, there are ways to solve this problem. Apart from daily standups,
    sync. meetings, you can proactively try to aim for more in-depth activities
    to improve the understanding and work on finding a common language.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>Workshops</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    When starting a new project, getting to know each other, ask for a workshop
    to go through the design and implementation processes. On-site with a client
    or remotely, brainstorm about some{' '}
    <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">
      MVP
    </Link>, internal application consisting of 2
    to 3 views.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Create a design together with developers, ask common questions, pay
    attention to the details, and try to explain all the important concepts to
    them.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Then, let developers take a lead and look at how they build an application,
    drawing on the board all of the components, relations between them, possible
    ways to avoid duplication to final implementation.
  </Paragraph>

    This should give all of you a fair knowledge about the workflows, tighten up
    the collaboration, and bonus points for integrating with a üçï+ üç∫.

  <Title level={4}>Processes</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    During the workshop time you can additionally brainstorm about the combined
    flow between product (clients), designers, and developers for the future.{' '}

    It could consist of a list of steps when creating a new feature, who, when,
    and why should be involved. Furthermore, you can sketch some initial FAQ or
    documentation. But, as always, prepare for the next increments, nothing is
    final in IT. üòÖ
