  <Title level={3}>Introduction</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Before the advent of ES6, there were only two ways to declare variables -
    global variables or using <Text code>var</Text> keyword (function or global
    scope).
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    With ES6, <Text code>let</Text> and <Text code>const</Text> keywords were
    introduced. Both can either have a global or block scope.{' '}
    <Text code>let</Text> can be updated, but not redeclared.{' '}
    <Text code>const</Text> as the name implies, can't either be updated or
    redeclared.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Variables</Title>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Let's learn the details about each of the above keywords by looking at the
    code examples. After that, we'll sum up recommendations and best practices.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="none">
    üëø Global
  </Title>
  <Paragraph>Globals are evil.</Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{globalVariableFirstExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    In the above example, we declared the <Text code>setTimeout</Text> variable
    without using any keyword and assigned the <Text code>Hello World</Text>{' '}
    string to it. This way, the variable became <Text strong>global</Text>.
    Additionally, we accidentally overwrote the existing{' '}
    <Text code>setTimeout</Text> function and it'll cause unwanted behavior.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_window.asp">window</Link>{' '}
    object has a lot of built-in properties that shouldn't be overridden. Unless
    you have a good reason (
    <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">
      polyfill
    </Link>
    , custom implementation), you should strive away from overriding existing variables,
    functions in the <Text code>window</Text> object.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    In the later sections, I'll explain how to avoid global variables overrides,
    for now, try to study <Text code>window</Text> object and make sure you
    don't come up with the exact same name when naming your variables.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="none">
    ‚ùå Var
  </Title>
  <Paragraph>
    <Text code>var</Text> has the same problems as global variables, but it can
    be used in a function scope to not pollute the global one.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{varVariableFirstExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    It's good that we didn't overwrite the outer <Text code>message</Text>{' '}
    variable inside of the <Text code>hello</Text> function as the inner{' '}
    <Text code>message</Text> variable had a function scope which is helpful in
    avoiding leaking of the variables to outer scopes. However, the outer{' '}
    <Text code>message</Text> variable still polluted the global scope.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Another bad thing about using <Text code>var</Text> is that it can be
    redeclared and updated which breaks the immutability approach of functional,
    declarative programming I highly recommend:
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{varVariableSecondExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    We redeclared and updated <Text code>canBeChangedAndUpdated</Text> variable
    3 times and it was applied to the global scope.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    In JavaScript, there is a concept of{' '}
    <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Glossary/Hoisting">
      Hoisting
    </Link>{' '}
    which <Text code>var</Text> also can't handle properly. üôà It means that
    variable declarations are moved all the way to the top of the global scope
    or function scope. Let's see how that works.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{varHoisting}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>
      Only the declaration of <Text code>x</Text> was hoisted as it printed{' '}
      <Text code>undefined</Text>
    </Text>
    . The best practice is to always include variable declarations and assigning
    values to them (in most scenarios) at the top as using hoisting is confusing
    and difficult to reason about. It should look like below.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{varHoistingGood}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    We got 5 when printing it through <Text code>console.log</Text> which is
    good. <Text code>y</Text> variable throws an error as it never was defined.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph strong>
    <Text code>var</Text> keyword gives too much "flexibility" and doesn't have
    strict rules. I don't use it anymore and couldn't be happier.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Let's see what improvements ES6 keywords bring to us.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="none">
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Let
  </Title>
  <Paragraph>
    The first improvement is that <Text code>let</Text> doesn't add to the{' '}
    <Text code>window</Text> object when declared as a global variable. However,
    it's still polluting the global scope if used like below.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{letVariableFirstExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    The second improvement is a block scope of <Text code>let</Text>. Let's see
    it in action.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{letScope}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    Outer <Text code>name</Text> variable polluted global scope but inner
    (inside <Text code>if</Text> statement) lived only there. Block scope is
    helpful in avoiding leaking of variables to outer scopes similar to function
    scope.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The third improvement is that <Text code>let</Text> can't be redeclared,
    let's see what happens if we try to do that.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{letVariableSecondExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    We get an error that notifies us <Text code>canOnlyBeUpdated</Text> variable
    can't be redeclared.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    It can still be updated which contradicts the immutability concept.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{letVariableThirdExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    And if it comes to hoisting, <Text code>let</Text> deals with it in a bit
    more strict way than <Text code>var</Text>.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{letHoisting}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    Hoisting still occurs but <Text code>let</Text> lands in{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-the-temporal-dead-zone/">
      Temporal Dead Zone
    </Link>{' '}
    thus it's not accessible and we get an error. <Text code>x</Text> should be
    declared and assigned (in most cases) before it's used.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Let's jump to the perfect one (almost) which is a <Text code>const</Text>{' '}
    keyword.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="none">
    ‚úÖ Const
  </Title>
  <Paragraph>
    The great thing about <Text code>const</Text> is that it has all the good
    properties from <Text code>let</Text> - block scoped, can't be redeclared
    and additionally, it can't be updated. üòç
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{constVariableFirstExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    <Text code>const</Text> keyword perfectly fits in functional, declarative
    programming with immutability in mind.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    An additional example of how good it feels to write code using{' '}
    <Text code>const</Text> can be found below.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{constVariableSecondExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph />
  <Title level={3} transform="none">
    Avoiding global scope
  </Title>
  <Paragraph>
    The simplest solution is to use a function or block scope. If you need
    something more organized, create a namespace to avoid name collisions.
  </Paragraph>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{globalVariableSecondExample}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    This way, the built-in <Text code>window.setTimeout</Text> is untouched and
    we can declare our variables in the namespace.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    There are more solutions for avoiding global variables in JavaScript.
    Similarly like in CSS there are CSS-in-JS solutions, BEM, SMACSS. Study the
    below list to avoid creating global variables.

    I hope it was something and you could've learned a ton from the article. We
