  <Title level={3}>Problem - Lack of a Design System üßê</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Let‚Äôs take{' '}

      MailChimp Design System
    </Link>{' '}
    as an example. They made it publicly available as they are probably proud of
    it and not scared of showing to others.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    A well-thought Design System is a fantastic way to promote the company -
    both for clients and potential candidates - everyone wants to work where
    processes are well settled.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    <Text strong>But it‚Äôs a lot of work.</Text> Choosing the right color
    palette, typography, spacing, layout rules, thinking through the whole{' '}
    <Link href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">
      Atomic Design
    </Link>{' '}
    approach and applying it to particular client needs is a Sisyphean task - it
    never ends.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Modern UI is all about complex state management, smooth transitions between
    views, data visualization - it‚Äôs really hard to code all of that from zero.
    As always, it‚Äôs about the right balance between design complexity and
    implementation.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    It takes a tremendous amount of work to brainstorm, collaborate, and shape
    the unique company‚Äôs solution for composing UI and Designs. And, usually,
    it‚Äôs done in a wrong way due to lack of time or competencies.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    When the product grows to multiple applications, things can easily get out
    of control. Components will be duplicated, designs might differ and the
    consistency won‚Äôt be kept. It‚Äôs a problem that a lot of companies are
    facing.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    Let‚Äôs learn how we could possibly solve it or make it less painful.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Solution üòé</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    In the company I work, we switched from{' '}
    <Link href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</Link> to{' '}
    <Link href="https://material.io/design/">Material</Link> - it was one of the
    best decisions ever and I don‚Äôt mean leaving Bootstrap behind, but rather
    not deciding on creating a Design System from the scratch instead of
    choosing Material Design.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    We also cheated a little bit, as there is a{' '}
    <Link href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</Link> for{' '}
    <Link href="https://reactjs.org/">React</Link> which implements all of the
    Material Design concepts - that helped us a lot. We not only gained the
    fundamentals of a Design System which can be extended but also received an
    open-source library full of components = saved time both for Developers and
    Designers = mission accomplished üöÄ.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    I‚Äôm not against creating things from the scratch and making a Design System
    unique to your brand - it just needs to be well covered and worth it. Ask
    the below questions to decide if you could reuse something that already
    exists or you really need to do it from ground zero:
  </Paragraph>
  <PostList data={questions} />
  <Paragraph>
    When choosing a predefined Design System and the Library (e.g. for React) it
    adds some learning curve, but it also saves a lot of time as already
    mentioned.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    If I would make this decision one more time - I would still vote for
    Material, it has this specific look & feel, and maybe Ant Design is more
    flexible and less intrusive, but I will leave the decision for you.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    It‚Äôs also quite easy to create uniqueness with icons, illustrations,
    branding colors, and the font - the rest of the concepts is usually the
    same.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Closing Notes üìã</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    If you see repeating patterns in your products, when it starts to grow -
    it‚Äôs the best time to react and start brainstorming about a need for a
    Design System - whether it will be something from the scratch (huge need for
    uniqueness of the brand) or predefined (functionalities takes overlook &
    feel).
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The next part will be about <Text strong>Happy Path Designs</Text> - in
    real-life scenarios, there is a lot of error handling, complex data
    problems, server limitations to consider and to include in designs (which
    often is skipped) üò± .
