title: React Components You Should Start Using Now
desc: There is a lot of pre-built, reusable, abstracted, encapsulated, and tested code available to use nowadays. In Frontend, we call this code a building block or shorter, a component. Good developers copy, great developers steal.

    time it's worth as icons will be unified across the entire system and it's better
    for designers to create an only brand, unique icons. There are optimization methods
    for decreasing bundle size, e.g. <Link

  <Paragraph>
    In the modern Frontend world, everything is built and composed of
    components. They're building blocks of any UI. Both Developers and Designers
    started using this term in their work. It might consist of different
    definitions, but the idea is the same.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    A Designer creates e.g. Button component in{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</Link> which has concrete
    properties such as width, height, color, font size, etc. It also has a
    concrete behavior, hover effect on click, and could be presented in
    different states. Given the Sketch file, a Developer can implement the
    Button component now. To avoid duplication and follow the{' '}
    <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">
      DRY principle
    </Link>
    , Button should be reusable and abstracted into e.g. React, Angular, Vue, or
    Web component. This component should have proper HTML structure, predefined CSS
    styles, JS behavior and can be controlled through properties, for example, it
    could have a property <Text code>type</Text> that would allow changing Button
    state to <Text code>promo</Text> or <Text code>secondary</Text>, by default it
    would have a <Text code>primary</Text> type.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The Button example might sound trivial, but in practice, there is a lot to
    cover. There needs to be a unified theme that includes different colors,
    spacing rules, typography settings, and much more. Components need to work
    in different browsers (god damn IE 😅) and be properly tested.{' '}
    <Text strong>When creating an MVP, there is no time for that.</Text>
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    And that's why we reuse what others built for us. MUI or Antd are the most
    popular Design Systems and have free to use{' '}
    <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</Link>,
    and React Component Libraries based on these principles. It's fun to build
    components from the scratch, but it's all about finding the right balance. I
    highly recommend checking out all the components in their API, but in this
    article, I will focus on some utility components that can save you time,
    reduce boilerplate code, unify styling in your application, and simplify
    workflow with designers.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    <Text strong>
      A common misconception is that MUI or Antd are absolute, that's not true!
    </Text>{' '}
    They provide the fundamentals that you can base off and still have a unique,
    brand look for the application. And all of that without spending a huge
    amount of time on implementing components behavior or supporting different
    tweaks in older browsers. It's basically a starter pack for your next MVP.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Components</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    I completely understand and respect Developers who code components from the
    scratch, but I also feel sorry for them to maintain, test, make the code
    compatible with all the possible browsers. And at the same time, deliver
    features, meet deadlines and often, work under the pressure.{' '}
    <Text strong>
      I'm kind of a lazy Developer who loves to reuse what others have built and
      expand on that to achieve the results
    </Text>
    .
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    I've been working on multiple Frontend projects, from small to large ones
    and I can assure you that in 99%, picking up a pre-built Design System with
    Component Library such as MUI or Antd was a perfect choice. There are
    downsides of this approach like with any other you would go for, but let's
    focus on the bright sides, rite?
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Let's dive in components you shall fall in love soon.

    )}

  <Paragraph>
    Most of the Grid Systems are based around{' '}

    and{' '}
    <Link href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">
      CSS Grid
    </Link>
    . A layout should be the very first thing you are working on. Decide on either{' '}

    </Link> approach and apply <Link href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/">
      RWD
    </Link> rules. Otherwise, it will consume time to refactor the <Text code>
      Layout
    </Text> component and adjust it for different devices. Usually, there is a <Text
      code
    >
      Row
    </Text> and <Text code>Col</Text> component, or just one <Text code>
      Grid
    </Text> which is controlled through props to be either a container or item.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    When you create a new view, page or want to have unified spacing and sizing
    of elements, start from <Text code>Grid</Text>, it will save you time.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="capitalize">
    Box
  </Title>
  <PostList
    data={implementationLinks(
      'https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/next/packages/material-ui/src/Box'
    )}

  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    There is a lot of discussion around the styling approach, either to choose{' '}
    <Link href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</Link>,{' '}
    <Link href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</Link>, or{' '}
    <Link href="https://cssinjs.org/">CSS-in-JS</Link>. I'm a fan of the last
    one and heavily use that either with{' '}
    <Link href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</Link> or JSS.
    It bothers me when I have to create a wrapper component just for one CSS
    property. On the other hand, <Text code>Box</Text> can simplify and unify
    styling through props, e.g. instead of providing exact value for margin, it
    could be multiplied by a base spacing value, which in MUI is 8 btw.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="capitalize">
    Typography
  </Title>
  <PostList
    data={implementationLinks(
      'https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/next/packages/material-ui/src/Typography',

    )}
  />
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    One of the fundamental concepts when creating a Design System. Line heights,
    font sizes, colors, font weights, there is a lot to consider, and Designers
    have a strong opinion on that one. Well-thought Typography can impact
    immensely on the user. It's hard to come up with rules and standards alone.
    The <Text code>Typography</Text> component should be used in almost every
    text, it will be much easier to refactor later on or apply new, brand rules
    from the designs.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="capitalize">
    Space
  </Title>
  <PostList
    data={implementationLinks(
      undefined,
      'https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/tree/master/components/space'
    )}
  />
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    There are use cases where you just want to apply the same padding or margin
    between elements. The <Text code>Grid</Text> seems a bit too heavy for that
    as it's not a complex layout concern. The <Text code>Box</Text> would also
    result in a bit too much boilerplate if used multiple times in the render
    method. <Text code>Space</Text> can help with that. It wraps all of the
    children components and applies equal spacing between them and can also help
    with alignment.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="capitalize">
    Hidden
  </Title>
  <PostList
    data={implementationLinks(
      'https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/next/packages/material-ui/src/Hidden'
    )}

  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    When you are using a Static Site Generator such as{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</Link>, using{' '}
    <Link href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html">hooks</Link> e.g.
    from{' '}
    <Link href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-media">react-media</Link>{' '}
    might break the layout in your application. During static assets generation,
    there is no information about the dimensions of the window. The solution to
    this problem is using a standard{' '}
    <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">
      CSS Media Queries
    </Link>{' '}
    or <Text code>Hidden</Text>. When your layout grows complex, it's better to
    split it into smaller components for each device than fighting with all
    conditions in the code.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="capitalize">
    Descriptions
  </Title>
  <PostList
    data={implementationLinks(
      undefined,
      'https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/tree/master/components/descriptions'
    )}
  />
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    There are <Text code>dl</Text>, <Text code>dt</Text>, <Text code>dd</Text>{' '}
    tags in HTML which are used for building a{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp">
      Description List
    </Link>
    . It can be tough to center a list when content has dynamic, unknown content.
    It's often the case that every description should be left centered. Also, with{' '}
    <Text code>Descriptions</Text> you gain semantic structure and simplified creation
    of details pages.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="capitalize">
    Icons
  </Title>
  <PostList
    data={implementationLinks(

    )}
  />
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    There is a separate package needed when using icons from MUI or Antd, but
    it's up to you which ones you will use. I can tell that 90% of icons are
    from these packages in my projects. Only 10% is reserved for unique icons,
    illustrations that are specific to my brand. With the <Text code>Icon</Text>{' '}
    it's easier to manipulate SVG, resize, and apply fill color, etc. And again,
    you get bonus points on consistency.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Closing notes</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Wow, we covered a lot in this article! I've linked resources between the
    lines with the hope that you will learn something new. Remember to be a Mr.
    Consistency when it comes to the balance between implementation and designs,
    but don't push too hard, communicate, and work out it all together.
  </Paragraph>

    There are a lot more components than I've described in this article, please
    hunt some and start using them in your application if you find they could be
    useful.
