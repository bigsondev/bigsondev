title: React Components you should start using now
desc: There is a lot of pre-built, reusable, abstracted, encapsulated, and tested code available to use nowadays. In Frontend, we call this code a building block or shorter, a component. Good developers copy, great developers steal.

      Usage

    , it's this missing component that you are looking for when using various Grid
    systems, e.g. for applying additional spacing or just any css property when you
    want to avoid additional boilerplate by creating a <Link
      size="small"
      href="https://styled-components.com/"
    >
      styled-components
    </Link> (or similar) wrapper just for one style. Didn't find a verion of this
    one in Antd.

    on your website, from headings to paragraphs with a lot of utilities included.

    , only found it int Antd, another utility component used for spacing, simplifies
    boilerplate, includes direction changing and can guard unified spacing between
    e.g. group of buttons.

    <Link size="small" href="https://material-ui.com/components/hidden/">
      MUI Hidden
    </Link>
    , I miss it a lot in Antd, had to implement my own components for hiding content
    on different breakpoints. MUI does a great job there by exposing a straightforward
    API that allows to manipulate content easily for different devices.
  </Text>,
  <Text size="preNormal">
    <Link size="small" href="https://ant.design/components/descriptions/">

    </Link>
    , often in admin portals, there is a lot of detail views where content should
    be properly formatted and adjusted even if elements have different widths. As
    with the previous one, I miss it a lot, but in MUI. Looks like combining these
    two powerful component libraries would make the world better.

    , at some point, I got bored of finding perfect icons for my websites,
    built-in packages came to the rescue. It's an additional bundle size, but
    most of the time it's worth as icons will be unified across the entire
    system and it's better for designers to create only brand, unique icons.
    There are optimization methods for decreasing bundle size, e.g.{' '}

  <Title level={3}>Installation</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Looking at the Cheat Sheet, <Text code>--save-dev</Text> flag will add
    Prettier to <Text code>devDependencies</Text> in the{' '}
    <Text code>package.json</Text> file. <Text code>--save-exact</Text> flag
    will install an exact version rather than using npm's default semver range
    operator.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    For the purpose of this article, npm is used, but personally I prefer{' '}
    <Link href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</Link> over npm and the command to
    install Prettier with it would be:
    <SyntaxHighlighter showCopy>
      yarn add --dev --exact prettier
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The <Text code>.prettierrc</Text> file is not the only one possible place
    for your configuration. Check out{' '}
    <Link href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html">
      the documentation
    </Link>{' '}
    for different options. Default settings are well thought, thus I only added
    one custom override.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The <Text code>.prettierignore</Text> file works similar to the{' '}
    <Text code>.gitignore</Text> file but in the context of which files Prettier
    should format. It's helpful for the Prettier CLI and your Editor to omit
    formatting of the files and/or directories (e.g. node_modules,
    package.json).
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    You could have a keyboard shortcut in your Editor to auto format code and
    execute it manually whenever you need. You could, but I will try to explain
    why you shouldn't ðŸ˜…. I use Prettier a lot and autoformatting became almost
    invisible to me. It feels so good to write code and don't bother with
    formatting at all, I often save my file with <Text code>Command + S</Text>{' '}
    (it's for Mac, on Windows it would be <Text code>Ctrl + S</Text>) shortcut
    which refreshes the latest changes thanks to{' '}
    <Link href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/">
      Hot Reloading
    </Link>{' '}
    ( in <Link href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</Link>,{' '}
    <Link href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</Link>, etc.) and yes,
    automatically formats my code very often. I reccomend that approach, in no
    time you will love it.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    Let's learn how you could use Prettier for more exciting things and what to
    avoid when integrating with other tools.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Integrations</Title>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Use Prettier for code formatting concerns, and linters for code-quality
    concerns as stated in{' '}
    <Link href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html">
      the documentation
    </Link>
    . In other words, Prettier should add a semicolon at the end of line, break long
    line into multiple ones, and linter should catch potential bugs, e.g. highlight
    using a variable that is not declared.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="capitalize">
    ESLint
  </Title>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    When using both ESLint and Prettier, <Text strong>they might clash</Text>,
    luckily{' '}
    <Link href="https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier">
      eslint-config-prettier
    </Link>{' '}
    comes to the rescue and turns all off the conflicting/unnecessary rules.
    Let's install it first by executing the following command:
    <SyntaxHighlighter showCopy>
      npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
    Then, in the <Text code>.eslintrc</Text> file add{' '}
    <Text code>"prettier"</Text> to the <Text code>"extends"</Text> array.
    Remember to put it last, so it gets the chance to override other configs.
    <SyntaxHighlighter language="json" showCopy>
      {`{
  "extends": [
    "...",
    "prettier"
  ]
}`}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4} transform="capitalize">
    Husky
  </Title>
  <Paragraph>
    Woof! It's an amazing tool to control git commands through the hooks, e.g.
    listen for
    <Text code>git commit</Text> or <Text code>git push</Text>. You already guessed
    it, we can add a hook to automatically run Prettier in order to have our code
    properly formatted, always. Just in case some developers will have their own
    opinion on Auto-format code locally, but in the end, code should always have
    unified formatting rules before pushing to the remote repository.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    There is a mention about{' '}
    <Link href="https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged">lint-staged</Link> in{' '}
    <Link href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html#git-hooks">
      the official documentation
    </Link>
    , but this tool might be a bit of overkill for starting, I will do it a bit differently.
    It's used to optimize the hook speed by affecting only changed files, the ones
    that are staged in git, but it can also cause unwanted behavior. I will use <Link href="https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick">
      pretty-quick
    </Link> to run Prettier on changed files instead.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Let's start by installing the following libraries:
    <SyntaxHighlighter showCopy>
      npm install --save-dev husky pretty-quick
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
    There is a lot to consider when properly configuring automation of tools,
    but I wouldn't force too much on <Text code>pre-commit</Text> hook and
    instead focus on <Text code>pre-push</Text> hook to allow more flexibility.
    <Box mt={2}>
      <Alert
        message={
          <Text size="small">
            it should require an extensive brainstorming with all the developers
            what the flow should be and when to run tests, linters, formatters,
            etc.
          </Text>
        }
        type="warning"
      />
    </Box>
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    Next, add a new property to the <Text code>package.json</Text> file:
    <SyntaxHighlighter language="json" showCopy>
      {`"husky": {
  "hooks": {
    "pre-push": "pretty-quick --staged"
  }
}`}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
    And that's it! Everytime someone will push to the remote repository, husky
    will run a <Text code>pre-push</Text> command which executes pretty-quick on
    changed files.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Closing Notes</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    In my honest opinion, automating manual work is exciting, but also
    challenging. The entire process needs to be well thought and discussed with
    all developers in the team. If you are working alone, Prettier will be a
    great addition.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    I prepared the list of thoughts based on my experience. Hopefully it will be
    useful!
