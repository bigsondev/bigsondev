  <Paragraph>
    What if there was a way to track users on the website, serve them different
    versions of one feature, test critical flows, have a reporting system to
    quickly resolve bugs, or even watch videos when some functionality crashes?
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Perhaps, the killer feature in your head is not used at all - time to learn
    what users are actually doing on your website. Do they quit too early as
    it’s way too slow or they’re overloaded with all the possibilities?
  </Paragraph>

    Let’s find out how you can possibly improve all of the above.

    These days, users won’t wait too long for loading a website, you have around{' '}
    <Text strong>3-5 seconds</Text> to make sure initial content is displayed
    and available for them. Lighthouse can help with that and thoroughly test
    the website’s performance.

    The killer feature is to be able to record the user’s behavior while he or
    she browses your website. All that knowledge will let you iterate, come up
    with new ideas, better solutions, and take another look from a different
    perspective.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The basic plan offers 300 recordings to keep in total and snapshot sessions
    can cover 100 recordings. Additionally, you can manage up to 3 heatmaps for
    free. It’s enough for small businesses.

  <Paragraph>
    It’s a convenient ability to be able to ship some hidden feature to
    production, test it on selected users, and see how it works under different
    circumstances - especially if there are inconsistencies between
    environments. It’s one of the greatest things LaunchDarkly can offer, as a
    bonus you could release different versions of the feature.

  <Paragraph>
    Sentry is a reporting system all the Frontend Developers need. Once the
    error happens, you get robust information about the browser, OS, URL,
    breadcrumbs - full history of the user actions. There is an option to add
    source maps to see the direct line of code where the error occurred and much
    more.

  <Paragraph>
    For such a long time there was a Selenium and all Java-based frameworks for
    testing. Cypress has a full JavaScript API and it’s amazing. It works on
    Chromium and already has support for multiple browsers. It’s straightforward
    to setup CI/CD where it records videos and snapshots once tests are failing.
    It’s a robust, mature e2e solution for the modern Frontend world.

  <Paragraph>
    When I was working as a Lead Frontend Developer, I and the team loved those
    tools. My recommendation is to add them earlier than later as you can really
    see the boost in conversions. Who knows, you might catch a bug, rethink a
    solution from another perspective or realize that something worked in your
    head, but it didn't "click" for the users. Have fun along the way.
