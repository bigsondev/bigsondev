    So far we've covered various solutions for fetching data in React from{' '}
    <Link href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_restful_api.htm">
      REST API
    </Link>{' '}
    in{' '}
    <GatsbyLink to="/blog/how-to-fetch-data-in-react-using-pokeapi/">
      this article
    </GatsbyLink>
    . Additionally, I explained fetching data as user types in or clicks e.g. on
    a button in <GatsbyLink to="/blog/fetch-data-in-react-as-user-types-or-clicks/">
      another article
    </GatsbyLink>. However, <Link href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</Link> is an
    amazing alternative to REST (at least from the Frontend perspective ðŸ˜…) that
    I enjoyed working with for the last 3 years and I couldn't stop myself from introducing
    you to the concept.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    This article is a supplementary example for fetching data using{' '}
    <Link href="https://graphql-pokeapi.vercel.app/">GraphQL pokeAPI</Link> and{' '}
    <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">
      browser fetch
    </Link>
    . I'll introduce you to the basics of it and we'll fetch my favorite Pokemon
    data which is OBVIOUSLY <Text strong>Charizard</Text>. ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥

    Wait for a second, one endpoint to rule them all? Get what you want? Yes,
    that's the beauty of GraphQL indeed.

    The Query
  </Title>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{query}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    GraphQL works with queries (fetching data) and mutations (add/delete/update
    data). We're solely focusing on queries in this article. As you can see in
    the above code, I'm just "telling" the server what I want to get, using the{' '}
    <Text code>query</Text> keyword, <Text code>pokemon</Text> name of the query
    with <Text code>name</Text> variable as <Text code>"charizard"</Text>.
    Lastly, I'm specifying what to get from that <Text code>pokemon</Text> query
    which is the <Text code>name</Text> and <Text code>front_default</Text>{' '}
    sprite.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    Take a look at the{' '}
    <Link href="https://graphql-pokeapi.vercel.app/api/graphql">
      pokeAPI Playground
    </Link>{' '}
    to "play" more with the concept. In REST, you would need to create separate
    endpoints for fetching different data and you'd always get all of it. (w/o
    filtering, pagination features, etc.) GraphQL query is elastic, you can
    minimize data fetching to what you need and write different queries for the
    same "query" (<Text code>pokemon</Text> in this case). You could e.g. fetch
    more data on the details page and have just name and sprite on e.g. list
    page.

    How to use the Query?
  </Title>
  <SyntaxHighlighter>{fetchQuery}</SyntaxHighlighter>
  <Paragraph>
    We're using the previously mentioned browser <Text code>fetch</Text>. If it
    comes to GraphQL, you can check the{' '}
    <Link href="https://graphql-pokeapi.vercel.app/">GraphQL pokeAPI</Link>{' '}
    documentation for more information but <Text code>body</Text> and{' '}
    <Text code>method</Text> are the most important ones. We're still using the{' '}
    <Text code>POST</Text> HTTP method as we would in REST API, but, when using
    it with GraphQL it's for fetching data (with a query) and not adding as it'd
    be with the REST API one. Our <Text code>query</Text> is sent as part of the{' '}
    <Text code>body</Text> using <Text code>JSON.stringify</Text> as we don't
    want to send a JS direct object. Also, take a look at the endpoint, it'll
    always be the same, no <Text code>/pokemon</Text> or{' '}
    <Text code>/pokemons</Text>, just <Text code>/graphql</Text> (always - yes,
    you can rename it). That's it.
  </Paragraph>

    For more complex GraphQL data management, I highly recommend{' '}
    <Link href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client">
      apollo-client
    </Link>
    . Loading, error handling is out of the scope of this article. You could go through
    the 2 others previously mentioned to learn these topics. (with REST API but it's
    similar as apollo-client also has a <Text code>useQuery</Text> hook)

  <Paragraph>
    Ok... ðŸ˜… The data fetching journey was fun. I still have caching and
    memoization concepts in my mind but there are just so many other things to
    write about. In the modern Frontend world there is a lot of exciting
    technologies, ain't it?
