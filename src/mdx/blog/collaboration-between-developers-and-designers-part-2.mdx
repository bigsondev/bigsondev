title: Developers And Designers - Part 2
desc: Communication is key when planning new features, projects, products. But who should be involved in a conversation with clients, should there be any review of designs, how to find a balance between designs and implementation? All of these concerns can lead to chaos, let‚Äôs learn how to avoid it during product creation.

  <Title level={3}>Problem - Chaos in planning</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    You can be at different stages in your project.{' '}

    usually have tight deadlines and overloaded sprints as it‚Äôs all about
    gaining traction and impressing clients with how quickly features can be
    delivered. Later in the project, there could be more maintenance and the
    atmosphere will stabilize. Commonly, there is more room for reflections by
    then.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph strong>But, chaos can happen at any time.</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Sometimes, when there is a lot of time pressure, the Product Owner might try
    to do multitasking between designers and developers, forcing them to work at
    the same time on the same feature. Ambitious developers can push designers
    off and stay closer to the client. Designers will be confused and will
    question themselves if their work has any value if it‚Äôs all about delivering
    functionalities. This breaks the order of things and that‚Äôs when‚Ä¶

    Chaos takes over.

  <Title level={4}>DESIGNERS - STAY CLOSE TO THE CLIENT</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    These folks are not only responsible for UI aesthetics, great UX, and making
    sure the application is consistent, but they also know how people are using
    websites, their behavior and possess some knowledge about the psychology
    behind their decisions. I haven‚Äôt met a single developer in my career who
    would elaborate on these topics, at least on daily basis, but they do üòÄ.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The above "stay close to the client‚Äù is all about early mockups, first
    interactive flows and shaping the fundaments of a prototype application
    based on the early client‚Äôs criteria,{' '}
    <Text strong>this is not a final design by any means</Text>.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Developers are important, as they need to evaluate the designs against
    technical limitations, potential pitfalls, edge cases and understand the
    business logic behind.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>But that‚Äôs happening a bit later (at least it should).</Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    <Text strong>Note</Text>: Usually, an Engineering Architect should be
    involved as well, just don‚Äôt invite all developers for these early
    discussions with the client.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>DEVELOPERS - PARTICIPATE IN EARLY DESIGN REVIEW</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    When the application prototype is created after endless hours of
    conversation with clients and rapid change of requirements, designers can
    finally rest‚Ä¶
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Well, not really. That‚Äôs when the worst starts and they need to confront
    mockups with developers üò± . This phase is crucial, as I‚Äôve had countless
    moments when proactive action, comment on early mockup could save dozens of
    time in later implementation, or just spot the gaps in edge cases, business
    criteria.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    We are just humans, it‚Äôs good to take a look at things from a different
    perspective and have more people involved (at different stages) to shape up
    the final product. IT is all about communication, filling the gaps in
    expertise and co-operation between people.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph breakParagraph>
    <Text strong>Note</Text>: Under time pressure, the Product Owner, or other
    personas might try to push developers to start implementation without asking
    them for any review - this is a big no no, and someone needs to act at this
    point to prevent loss of time and costs - forcing an early prototype can be
    a huge mistake, the balance and at least minimum time for developers to
    review an early design is crucial there. Also, allowing developers to
    participate in design review will build their motivation.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={4}>DON‚ÄôT DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    This one is my favorite. Developers are implementing a new feature based on
    early prototypes and deploy it to a staging/QA/prod environment. The Product
    Owner is super happy and shows it to the client. Designer comes in and
    points out 10+ differences between implementation and the final design
    (which was not available by the time developers coded the feature). Then,
    the next increments start, improve this, improve that, but also deliver the
    next features, and technical debt grows like crazy.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph strong>
    The above leads to a lot of confusion, panic, and chaos which is not easy to
    fix.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    When designers are adjusting prototype based on the review they received,
    e.g. from Architect, Product Owner, or developers to shape final design,
    developers should be working on different features. It‚Äôs a golden rule that
    designers finish their work before developers do the implementation, but
    it‚Äôs a perfect world scenario.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph lastParagraph>
    When starting a new project, there is a lot of work needed to boilerplate
    the application, setup CI/CD, and think about overall architecture - this
    can be done without waiting for designers to finish the final design. On the
    other hand, sometimes it‚Äôs impossible to wait as the deadline is way too
    tight. This is where the Design System comes in handy and can unblock
    developers to deliver features, and save a lot of work for Designers.
  </Paragraph>
  <Title level={3}>Closing Notes</Title>
  <Paragraph>
    The next part will be about <Text strong>Lack of a Design System</Text> üî•
    which will be a complementary example to the ‚ÄûDon‚Äôt do both at the same
    time‚Äù solution.
